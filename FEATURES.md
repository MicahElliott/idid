## Elevator Pitch

Idid is a personal system to roughly capture and organize your
finished work into the things you did, and craft those into
accomplishments, which roll up into reports and intropections that you
can use to evaluate your project time over any interval.

Benefits:

- you recall what you did in the day. It then aids you in
- assemble your activity into accomplished goals
- learn from your activity how to improve your time/efforts
- separate your internal introspection from what you share externally
- understand what you most enjoy and hate doing
- ascribe a net worth to every day

Unlike TODO apps that help you think about what you _should do_, Idid
tracks and organizes what you actually **did do**.

## Tenets/Workflow

### Anytime TODO/Goal entry (optional)

- A normal TODO entry system with categories, reordering, etc.
- Start the day with prompt to think about the day and create some goals.

### Prompt-driven hourly reminder system

Record what you did constantly: hourly prompt, and async anytime

### Summarize/organize/retro on organized day into accomplishments

- EOD prompt to summarize/retro
- Guide with categorizing

### Roll up accomplishments into key introspectives

Reporting templates, weekly, monthly; via email and in-app

- daily standup
- sprint/weekly retro
- resume
- 1x1 with boss
- monthly status reporting
- annual review
- editable in $EDITOR (?)
- personal changelog generation




## Niceties

Must have (v1):

- desktop and mobile
- sync across clients
- tagging into categories, call-outs/accomplishments
- figure out which of your days are productive and themes
- track how much time goes into any tag
- easily refer to any todo via completable hash-shortcut

Nice-to-have (v2):

- save status reports in hierarchy in git, push to private gh repo
- generate a word doc from dunnits (from markdown)
